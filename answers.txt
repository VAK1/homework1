What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?


Okay, so you have two branches in Git and you want to combine their changes, right? The two ways to do that are "merging" and "rebasing".

Merging is like taking all the changes from one branch and just dumping them into the other branch. It's like getting all your friend's notes from a class and just putting them into your notebook without worrying about the order.

Rebasing is like taking the changes one by one and putting them on top of the other branch, like a stack of papers. It's like copying your friend's notes and rewriting them in your own words in the order that you took the class.

So, to sum it up: merging is just putting everything together and rebasing is putting it together in a specific order. Hope that helps!
